# Senior Enrichment Project Guidelines

  ### The Premise

  You are the CTO of the Margaret Hamilton Interplanetary Academy of JavaScript. Create a RESTful web platform that allows you to manage your students and campuses. Before getting started, please carefully review the expectations as outlined in the [grading rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5FekpyZqAiTmSU0ipAAHTGyIoInC-m-1a75YkMcejM).

  ### The tools

  Use at least Sequelize, Express and React when creating this app. This app is small, so just using React is reasonable, but note that without practicing with more frontend libraries you will have a steep learning curve in senior phase. If you are going forward with ***just React*** you will benefit from **deleting all references to React-Redux, Redux and React-Router** (so you don't confuse yourself with trying to use something in half your files and not the other half). 

  If you feel ready, start by incorporating React-Router, Redux and React-Redux (we helped get you started with this!)! If you go this route, it will be great practice and will prepare you **well** for senior phase.

  ### Routes

  ```
  GET
  - all campuses
  - a campus by id
  - all students
  - a student by id
  ```

  ```
  POST
  - new campus
  - new student
  ```

  ```
  PUT
  - updated student info for one student
  - updated campus info for one campus
  ```

  ```
  DELETE
  - a campus
  - a student
  ```
